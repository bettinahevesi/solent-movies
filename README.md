# Solent Movies

I built a web-based system that can be used by movie lovers to learn about and rate movies. It was intended that the site would be publicly maintained in that any user can register, log into the system and then carry out typical administrative operations such as adding and editing information. Standard technologies was used such as HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript, PHP and MySQL
